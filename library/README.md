# engine-lib
Test Engine Standard Library

The project folder simulates a user project folder. The web folder contains a Sveltekit project used to simulate the Rust script.

Also, make sure to run to install wasm-pack as a prereq `cargo install wasm-pack`. Run `yarn dev` to preview the app and `yarn build` to compile the Rust scripts into wasm. To watch the project, run `yarn watch`.
