# engine

Engine pet project... Hopefully some progress can be made :(

To install, install the Tauri prerequisites from the [Tauri prerequsites page](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites/). Also install wasm pack using `cargo install wasm-pack` since the engine uses wasm pack to compile the Rust project scripts.

Run `yarn dev` to preview the app. Run `yarn build` to build the app.
